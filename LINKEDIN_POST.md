# 🚀 Excited to Launch: "Corporate Dark Theme" for VS Code

I’m thrilled to announce the release of **Corporate Dark Theme**, a premium VS Code theme designed for developers who value focus, clarity, and a modern aesthetic.

After spending countless hours in the editor, I wanted to create a theme that balances a neutral, professional environment with high-contrast accents where they matter most.

### Why "Corporate Dark Theme"?
✅ **Neutral Charcoal Palette**: A sleek `#121212` background that reduces eye strain during long coding sessions.
✅ **Smart Accents**: Features vibrant orange highlights (`#EF7F1A`) specifically for external service calls and support classes—helping you navigate complex logic faster.
✅ **Full UI Coverage**: Not just an editor theme! Includes custom styling for the Activity Bar, Terminal, Debugger, and Sidebar for a seamless experience.
✅ **Lightweight & Clean**: Built for speed and focus, with zero clutter.

Whether you're building microservices or front-end dashboards, **Corporate Dark** provides the professional atmosphere you need to stay in the zone.
